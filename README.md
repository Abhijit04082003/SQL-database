# Project Description

Using the SDLC, this database was designed to help my friend(Nithin) organize his video game store.

Nithin owns a video game store that needs some organization. He has many games with different categories, prices, ratings, and publishers. Nithin loves to know all the information about his games. He makes sure he has facts about the publisher stored. He keeps publisher information like who the founders are and where they have their headquarters. Each game has only one publisher. Nithin also keeps tracks of his customers. He saves their email, phone number, name, and birthdate. If the customer is under 18, they can’t buy a game that’s rated R. Nithin keeps track of all his orders with order numbers and records of which customer made the order, the items bought, and the calculated total price. He also has to keep track of his employees. They each have names, job titles, and salaries. This database is designed to keep Nithin's store organized
and help him easily find out information like:

  - What action games are in the store? 
  - Does Nithin own Minecraft for Xbox?
  -  What games by Notch does Bob own?
  -   What games are under 20$?
   - Which games are R-rated?
  - Can Rohan buy her favorite R-rated game?
 - How much does Soumyadip get paid?
  - Where is the Bethesda headquarters?
  -  What was the total for Rohan's last order?
